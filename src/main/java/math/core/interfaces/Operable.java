/**

	Abstracts the four basic mathematical operations.

	<p><b>Key Features:</b></p>
	<ul>

		<li>Standardized contract for arithmetic operations</li>
		<li>Type-safe implementation through generics</li>
		<li>Extends {@link java.lang.Comparable} for value comparison</li>

	</ul>

	<p><b>Usage Example:</b></p>
	<pre>{@code

		public class MyClass implements Operable<MyClass>{

			public int compareTo(MyClass myClass){return //logic}

			public MyClass add(MyClass other){return //logic}

			public MyClass subtract(MyClass other){return //logic}

			public MyClass multiply(MyClass other){return //logic}

			public MyClass divide(MyClass other){return //logic}
